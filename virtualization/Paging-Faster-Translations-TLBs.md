To speed address translation, we are going to add what is called a **_Translation-Lookaside Buffer_**, or TLB. 

A TLB is part of the chipâ€™s memory-management unit (MMU), and is simply a hardware cache of popular virtual-to-physical address translations; thus, a better name would be an address-translation cache. 

Upon each virtual memory reference, the hardware first checks the TLB to see if the desired translation is held therein; if so, the translation is performed (quickly) without having to consult the page table (which has all translations).
